## Jets Project

### Skill Distillery Week 2 Homework

Program to view jets in an airfield and add new jets.

#### Project Description

This program will allow you to:
* List the number of jets in the airfield
* "Fly" them by displaying the time of flight
* View the fastest jet
* View the jet with the longest range
* Add a new jet to the fleet

Technologies used:
* Java
* Git
* Github


#### Lessons Learned
* Needed to loop all of the options so that the program wouldn't need to be re-run after adding a new jet to the fleet
* Needed to compare objects in an array in a loop but return the result outside of the loop
